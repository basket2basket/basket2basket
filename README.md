# Purpose
Basket2Basket is a web application that is built to serve the local community as a platform to buy, sell, and trade personal goods. It is meant to emulate the wholesome environment of a farmers market with the efficiency and ease of eCommerce. A user’s access to Basket2Basket is restricted to their own specific neighborhood so the transactional nature of the application is kept their own backyard! Locals have the opportunity to share their homegrown blueberries and fresh baked bread beyond nextdoor neighbors which allows strengthening of the community.
